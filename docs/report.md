# Protein Residue-Residue Contact Prediction Task

## Task Definition

The goal of this project is to predict residue-residue contacts in protein structures. Residue-residue contact prediction is crucial for understanding protein folding, function, and interactions. Accurate contact maps can significantly enhance the accuracy of protein structure prediction and facilitate various downstream applications in bioinformatics and structural biology.

## Data

The primary data source for this project is the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which provides a comprehensive repository of protein structures. The PDB files were downloaded using the following command:

```
rsync -rlpt -v -z --delete --port=33444 rsync.rcsb.org::ftp_data/structures/divided/pdb/ ./pdb
```

### Preprocessing Steps

Decompression: The downloaded PDB files are compressed in .gz format. These files were decompressed using a custom Python script that utilizes multiprocessing to handle multiple files in parallel.

Filtering: After decompression, the PDB files were filtered to retain only those proteins that contain 'CA' (alpha carbon) atoms. This step is crucial because 'CA' atoms are used to define residue-residue contacts.

Contact Map Generation: For each filtered PDB file, a contact map was generated. A contact map is a binary matrix where each element indicates whether a pair of residues is in contact, typically defined by a distance threshold (e.g., 8 Ã…).

As the PDB database is huge, the small portion was used for the experiments.

The command for preprocessing was

## Model

As a model was used ESM2 (esm2_t6_8M_UR50D) model and it's contact prediction head [1].

## Experiments

The main idea of an experiment lies in the fact that attention layers of ESM2 model contain the structural information.
